# Actionable Feedback Analyzer | Explainable AI, LLMs, Python, PyTorch

## Project Overview
The **Actionable Feedback Analyzer** is a scalable AI system designed to analyze customer feedback using Large Language Models (LLMs) while ensuring model transparency through explainability techniques. This project leverages pre-trained BERT models to classify sentiments from customer reviews and provides interpretable insights.

## Key Features
- **Scalable AI System**: Analyzes and interprets customer feedback across a dataset of 1.5 million reviews.
- **Explainable AI**: Implements SHAP and attention visualization to enhance model transparency and user understanding.
- **Optimized for Performance**: Processes 20,000 feedback entries per minute with response times under 0.5 seconds.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Amazon Product Reviews Dataset**, which is accessible [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/amazon-reviews/).

## Installation
